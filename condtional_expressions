# a conditional expression is a compact way to evaluate a condition and return a value based on the result
# it is also known as a ternary operator
# syntax: value_if_true if condition else value_if_false

# example 1
num = 5

print("positive" if num > 0 else "non-positive") # output: positive

#example 2

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

print("you are an adult" if age >= 18 else "you are young") # output: you are an adult or you are young based on age input

# example 3

num_1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))

print("even" if num_1 % 2 == 0 else "odd") # output: even or odd based on num_1 input

# example 4

numb = 5
a = 6
b = 10
max_num = a if a > b else b # output: 10
print(max_num)

# example 5

age_1 = int(input("Enter your age: "))
status = "adult" if age_1 >= 18 else "teenager" if age_1 >= 13 else "child" # nested conditional expression
print(f"You are an {status}") # output: You are an adult/teenager/child based on age_1 input
