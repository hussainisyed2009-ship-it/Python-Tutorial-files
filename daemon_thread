# darmon thread = a thread that runs in the background, not important for program to run
#                 your program will not wait for daemon threads to complete before exiting
#                 non-deamon threads cannot normally be killed, stay alive alive until task is done

#                 ex. background taks, garbage collection, waiting for input, long running process, etc.
